# Berserker
## StackUnderflow @ 11/11/2023 (DD/MM/YYYY)

The game can be summarized as 1v1 battles between players with a blade ball like combat system.
Each user is armed with an ability and a parry move. Using which they must kill their counterpart.

The game revolves around a round system. Each round begins with the selection of a "Berserker" and "Champion". 
A "Rage Level" controls the stats of the berserker, increasing when they get parried.

The berserker must be killed, since their power increases with the amount of times they are parried away. 
The berserker can only be killed when their "Rage Level" is higher than 60%, viz. being parried over 10 times.
